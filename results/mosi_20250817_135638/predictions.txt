and they did a lot of good things with it	1.089551329612732	1.600000023841858

theyre back to you having two killers thankfully	-0.5027320981025696	0.800000011920929

hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than scream 3 and	0.7854437828063965	1.2000000476837158
3 and actually is better than scream 2 a	0.7041227221488953	1.600000023841858
2 a lot of people dont like scream 2 i	-0.19242863357067108	0.0
2 i think its highly underrated	0.5788146257400513	0.800000011920929
i hated scream 3 but	0.9164984226226807	-2.4000000953674316
scream 3 but i think this one did beat scream 2 now	1.0553206205368042	1.2000000476837158
now i didnt really like the first hour that much though	-1.024021863937378	-0.4000000059604645
im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way	-0.2752576172351837	-0.800000011920929
i think xxx i want to see it	0.36122044920921326	1.600000023841858
but it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent	-0.5292191505432129	-1.0
im just kinda like no this is going to far	-1.2173413038253784	-1.0
it only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed	-0.4710634648799896	-0.4000000059604645
but unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise	-0.7075400352478027	-2.799999952316284
that i got very little joy out of	-0.19322247803211212	-2.200000047683716
in fact i got mostly pain out of it	-0.06689135730266571	-2.799999952316284

now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that emily browning in this movie looks like shes underage	0.5124266743659973	-1.0
but i dont know	-1.5047513246536255	-0.5
that kind of looks like video game in a certain wayin fact	-0.2546009123325348	-0.4000000059604645
the first time she goes in it looks like a japanese temple	-0.4187658429145813	0.0

whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that wayits kind	0.15844213962554932	0.0
of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the matrix films did	-0.4171641170978546	0.20000000298023224

its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread	0.3749021589756012	-2.5999999046325684
now the real star of something borrowed is ginnifer goodwin	-0.18533030152320862	1.2000000476837158
kind of yells and screams through the whole movie	0.18579430878162384	-1.25
and if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter	-0.6648603677749634	-2.0
um it kind of follows the path of my best friends wedding 1997 julia roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of my best friends wedding	0.17532247304916382	-0.4000000059604645
there are some funny moments	-0.3640665113925934	0.20000000298023224
but mostly its just kate hudson being very annoying	-0.21907339990139008	-1.600000023841858
and i think its predictable up an to a point	0.396513432264328	-1.0
i think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict	0.07854235172271729	0.4000000059604645
and we second guess ourselves	0.7361868023872375	0.0

but it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did	-0.30069899559020996	-1.2000000476837158
in fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to	-0.4972594082355499	-1.600000023841858
i didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end	-0.5883975028991699	-0.6000000238418579

the aliens are really awesome	1.8907127380371094	2.799999952316284
they designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical	0.9331558346748352	2.4000000953674316
and they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know	0.7405700087547302	2.4000000953674316
and they always like pull out something new	-0.13500231504440308	0.5

but they give you a good amount of information about them	0.3401946723461151	0.800000011920929
like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking	0.043508097529411316	1.3333333730697632
and it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie	0.23123206198215485	1.2000000476837158

the two women in this movie are particularly good looking	0.8986034393310547	1.399999976158142
and so thats pretty entertaining	0.6966080665588379	1.600000023841858
this is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies	0.39633017778396606	1.2000000476837158
and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time	-0.4335888624191284	-2.0
he is average	0.6784685850143433	0.20000000298023224
and its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there	0.26895880699157715	-1.399999976158142
uh stormshadow is very cool	1.4074161052703857	2.0

id give it three stars	0.8697017431259155	1.0
only because it was very predictable very predictable	-0.17045898735523224	-1.2000000476837158
but very predictable	0.5298367738723755	-1.5
that um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy	-0.04120709002017975	-1.7999999523162842
i dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad	-0.09228619188070297	0.0
so if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie	0.30624788999557495	0.6000000238418579
i would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie	0.855094313621521	0.6000000238418579
beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of	-0.6646661758422852	-1.399999976158142
other than that it was a good movie	0.8806397914886475	1.25

nothing new is brought in those predator series no surprises no big twist no finish	-0.6588431000709534	-2.4000000953674316
i like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical	-0.7568238377571106	-1.7999999523162842
althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not	-1.0831679105758667	-1.2000000476837158
in the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly	-0.07193576544523239	-2.200000047683716
you dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody	-0.866521954536438	-2.0
of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this	-0.3500954806804657	-1.399999976158142
but nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points i guess	-0.7543739676475525	0.800000011920929
what disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time	-0.35141846537590027	-2.0
and i know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them	-0.07963952422142029	0.0

although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense	-0.19480560719966888	0.6000000238418579
he co laurence fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing	-0.2831224203109741	-2.0
just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie	0.22763757407665253	-1.399999976158142
its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters	0.6418402194976807	-2.0
it dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie	-0.08001889288425446	-1.399999976158142
in finale i would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series	-0.10025841742753983	-1.600000023841858

and he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one	0.2882262170314789	1.600000023841858
um after watching this movie i dont really think thats necessarily true um i think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um i think they tried to add a lot of heart	-0.10322985053062439	-1.0
and it just seems like too much too fast i mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together i mean its just way too much too fast they try	-0.7584280967712402	-2.200000047683716

and its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again	-0.9010615348815918	-2.0
because its um its an audience pleaser you know	0.5932044386863708	1.600000023841858

and is fun to watch	1.2333611249923706	1.7999999523162842

therere also two lord of the rings grads which i absolutely love	0.1618603616952896	2.4000000953674316

and quite honestly i wish ive seen this over the summer	0.6831457018852234	1.600000023841858
because if ive seen it over the summer i probably wouldve rated it best action movie i saw this summer	0.8124141097068787	2.0
this summer was kind of weird with the action movies if you ask me	-0.01534093264490366	-0.800000011920929
i did like transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that	-0.48219627141952515	2.0

he does a great job with his snake eyes which is always cool to see that	1.5507547855377197	1.7999999523162842
joe movie is how international it was it was very divert	0.8566590547561646	0.800000011920929
but let me first say this i liked it more than i expected i would	0.5583373308181763	0.800000011920929
this film is slavishly devoted to the original book or nov novella uh by uh charles dickens	0.4613710939884186	0.800000011920929
number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine	0.1954536885023117	0.75
my 8 year old was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying	0.11872971057891846	-1.0
let me say this if your christianity is extremely legalistic this is the film for you	0.552636981010437	0.5
cause this is a film that basically says you know what you should do you should take care of poor people because jesus told us to take care of poor people and if you dont take care of poor people youre gonna burn in hell	-0.6219092011451721	-1.2000000476837158
so laughing if thats your form of christianity its a christian film	0.7191258072853088	-0.20000000298023224
um its not my form	0.5775840878486633	-1.5
um another thing about this film is in its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking dickensonian english	-0.4046924412250519	-1.0
sometimes i missed what was being said	-0.4892706573009491	-0.6000000238418579
therefore a lot of social commentary goes woop sound effect over your head	0.6028323769569397	-1.399999976158142
or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all	-0.998140811920166	-0.6666666865348816
um all this stuff about debtors prison for instance doesnt really um jive here in 21st century america	-0.5186413526535034	-1.7999999523162842
and this film is this amazing like i say slavish devotion to charles dickens with an amusement park ride	1.2538973093032837	2.200000047683716
because this thing is is meant to be seen in 3d which	0.05117599666118622	0.6000000238418579
and throughout the film youre going sound effects laughing either from the terrifying characters	1.024684190750122	0.6000000238418579
or most likely from going very quickly through london with you know demon horses chasing you so uh theres that	0.10065124183893204	0.20000000298023224
also about the animation the people just like in polar express a film i really did not like	-0.05582854896783829	-2.0
um the people seemed sort of dead	-0.279953271150589	-1.600000023841858
except their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the polar express	-0.04223188757896423	-0.6000000238418579
and thats a lot to be said for a one minute review	0.39319488406181335	0.20000000298023224
i actually like the film	1.1175929307937622	2.0

the trailers werent really doing it much for me	-0.6032949686050415	-1.2000000476837158
so i really was not looking forward to seeing this movie	0.21163634955883026	-2.0
um but i guess say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that i read	-0.20887093245983124	-0.20000000298023224
but i didnt mind it	-1.0259120464324951	0.4000000059604645
